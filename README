HPC Ports
===========

This set of tools is "inspired" by the FreeBSD Ports and macports systems
and is intended to provide an easy way to install packages on High Performance 
Computing (HPC) systems.  The goal is to allow easy building of packages
with a consistent compiler toolchain and system-customized compile options.

If this is a fresh clone of the source tree, you must do:

$> ./init.sh

before running any make commands.  For usage, type:

$> make help

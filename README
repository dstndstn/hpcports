HPCPorts
===========

This set of tools is "inspired" by the FreeBSD Ports and macports systems
and is intended to provide an easy way to install packages on High Performance 
Computing (HPC) systems.  The goal is to allow easy building of packages
with a consistent compiler toolchain and system-customized compile options.


Common Commands
-----------------

$> make help

$> make status

$> make install

Fetch, extract, configure, compile, and install all packages.

$> make purge

Other Commands
----------------

$> make fetch

Per-Package Commands
----------------------

You can also have fine-grained control over the individual packages.
If you install an individual package, all dependencies will be
installed first.

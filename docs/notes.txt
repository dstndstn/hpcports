Overall philosopy

The building of each package is independent, and assumes dependencies are built and installed.

At build time, a staging directory for every HPCP_HOST is created.  A perl extraction script is called.  If the package is overridden, then only the fake module files and other things are created. For overridden packages, there are alternative rules in pkg.make

Top level perl program (hpcp) manages dependencies, which are stored in a perl hash dump.  This DB is recomputed with "hpcp update" command.  Subsequent launching of the hpcp program loads this DB.  Store git hash in this DB so we can auto-update.

When computing dependencies, given a list of high-level dependencies, compute the set of full low-level dependencies for each package.

ALL packages have an 8 character hash appended to their intrinsic version.  This dep-hash is based on the versions of all dependencies.

CHANGE:  MOD_SUFFIX --> HPCP_MOD_SUFFIX

CHANGE:  HPCP_TARGET --> HPCP_HOST.

CHANGE:  Add HPCP_BUILD variable which specifies that we are cross compiling and specify the name of the BUILD config.  Add HPCP_BUILD_PREFIX to specify the install location of the BUILD tools.  Add HPCP_BUILD_OVERRIDE to specify packages to override in the HPCP_HOST config and to substitude from the HPCP_BUILD install.

CHANGE:  in package vars files, use new var names.

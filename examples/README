This directory contains some examples:

example.make : 
	
	Example system config documenting the parameters
	that can be specified.  You first part of the file
	name (e.g. "example") is what you should set the
	HPCP_TARGET environment variable to.  This file 
	goes in the top-level system directory.

example.module : 

	*OPTIONAL* file containing a modulefile snippet
	that will be inserted into the hpcp base modulefile.
	This can contain module commands to set up the correct
	environment for building and using HPCPorts for a
	particular combination of HPCP_TARGET and HPCP_ENV.
	This file goes in the top-level system directory.

example/ : 

	This directory contains an example package.  It can be
	used as a template for new packages.  A new package can
	be added to the packages directory, and then you can
	manually run "make update" from the top-level, or commit
	the package and then this will be run automatically.

	Makefile : build rules for the package

	version : file containing a static version for the package

	deps : names of packages that this package depends on

	vars : a list of environment variable to export when the
	module is loaded or which can be used by other packages
	during their build process.  Here is what they do.  Note:
	PREFIX = $(HPCP_PREFIX)/$(PKG_NAME)-$(PKG_VERSION)

		path = dir : add $PREFIX/dir to $PATH
		
		man = dir : add $PREFIX/dir to $MANPATH

		ld = dir : add $PREFIX/dir to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

		header = dir : define <package>_CPPFLAGS to be
			-I$PREFIX/dir

		data = dir : define <package>_DATA to be $PREFIX/dir

		lib_{CC,MPICC,CXX,MPICXX,F77,MPIF77,FC,MPIFC} = <libs>
			set the variabe <package>_LIBS_{CC, etc} to <libs>
